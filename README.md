# Spinni Engine

A minimalist 3D rendering engine that creates beautiful ASCII art animations using only text characters. Written in pure JavaScript with no dependencies.

## Features

- Multiple 3D shapes (cube, sphere, torus, helix, octahedron, and a cute bear)
- Smooth rotation and zoom controls
- Real-time rendering using ASCII characters
- Z-buffer implementation for proper depth handling
- Dynamic shading and lighting effects
- UI

## Controls

- **Drag**: Rotate the shape
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out
- **Switch Shape**: Cycle through different shapes
- **Reset View**: Return to default position

## Implementation

The engine uses ASCII characters for rendering 3D shapes, implementing:
- 3D to 2D projection
- Z-buffer for depth handling
- Normal-based shading
- Real-time rotation and scaling

## Getting Started
